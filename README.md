GroupLens is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the 
University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, USA - specializing in recommender systems. 
GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating data sets from the MovieLens 
web site (https://movielens.org). The group provides several datasets. The datasets were 
collected over various periods of time, depending on the size of the set. The dataset consists 
of several sub-datasets. We are interested only in the file called (u.data), which includes 
users, movie, rating and timestamp.
